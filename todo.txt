visual feedback on camera errors

button to reset to default settings

add (tm) at appropriate places for Cedar

investigate tethered alternative to wifi

Remove refresh rate control. Go full speed; when dwelling for more than N
seconds drop to 5hz.

Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing image

status LED
* wifi connection status

create Android app
create IOS app
* benefits (for both): control over screen rotation; access to location info; switching
  app to SkySafari?
* control over wifi on phone?

Cedar Journal
* capture Cedar Sky goto requests (and whether target was reached)
* capture RA/DEC when long-enough dwell detected
TBD

Cedar Sky
Remaining work:
* add more catalogs
  - Caldwell (list, not catalog-- affects display logic re naming)
  - Arp, Hickson (lists, not catalogs)
  - double stars
  - stars down to some limit

* identify constellation of boresight
* constellation lines

Push-to ra/dec button: pops up text entry field

remote ops, proxied via phone
* update cedar server

help system
* long press? (GestureDetector wrapped around a widget)
* 'i' icons?

* flip options? To match telescope FOV orientation.
  - sync with SkySafari?

Splash screen

Help page
