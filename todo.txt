Default pattern database:
* update for proper density
* go down to 5deg? Helps 10deg fields that are partially obstructed. Doc this.
* tune for Hopper
* separate (broader) database for DIY version

auto-detect alt-az vs equatorial (with manual override)

Base python scripting support for working with Cedar grpc server.

Mic button on keyboard for voice input. Can work offline? Good for
"en gee cee oh five six" utterances?

Make polar advice data block tappable, zooms to larger dialog.
* polar advice can just be an "idea" icon.

"serve engine" pipeline stage. Moves some logic out of cedar_server.rs.

Multiple scopes
* FOV
* saved alignment

Ability to access (and download) saved images in Cedar Aim.
Maybe save them to web side in the first place?
High-quality jpg with exif info.
Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing/downloading image

Tetra3
* use brightness ratio (broadly quantized) of most separated stars in
  pattern as additional discriminant (post hash lookup? or incorporate
  into hash?)

time display:
* local time, UTC
* time to sunset/sunrise, astro twilight
* moonrise/set
* display all? selectable?

Catalog
* text search: preprocess input, e.g. the following should all locate
  NGC0426 (and maybe others):
  NGC0426
  NGC426
  NGC 426
  NGC 0426
  N426
  N 426

visual feedback on camera errors
visual feedback on connectivity errors
visual feedback on SkySafari connection

Refresh rate: Go full speed; when dwelling for more than N
seconds drop to 2hz. Use accelerometer to quickly detect resumption of
motion.

eq vs alt/az setting
* convey to SkySafari

Cedar Pole Align
* top-level mode?
* alert if no observer location
* alert if not tracking mount (or not roughly polar aligned)
* guidance for where to point scope
* king method?
Polar alignment technique:

https://www.considine.net/aplanatic/align.htm

Cedar Journal
* capture Cedar Sky goto requests (and whether target was reached)
* capture RA/DEC when long-enough dwell detected
TBD

Cedar Sky
Remaining work:
* add more catalogs
  - Caldwell (list, not catalog-- affects display logic re naming)
  - Arp, Hickson (lists, not catalogs)
  - double stars
  - stars down to some limit
  - what else?
* find non-python solution for asteroids/comets
* way to add new solar system object, e.g. comet
  - cloud-based?
* meridian ordering (advanced)
* identify constellation of boresight
* identify constellation of planet
* constellation lines

Push-to ra/dec button: pops up text entry field

remote ops, proxied via phone
* download logs
* send bug reports

"advanced" mode enable
* polar alignment advice

bug report

interoperation with SkySafari
* switch apps?
* split screen?
* picture-in-picture?

vignetting calibration

Wifi management
* switching wifi mode-- setting in web UI?
* bluetooth? disable if not using?

FITS support for saved images? Other formats?

logging
* observer log is separate
* move cedar_log.txt to sane directory (cmd line arg?)

motion classification
* adjust update interval

UI:
* operation controls
  - save image: add confirmation+rename

Sounds for various actions/events in app?
