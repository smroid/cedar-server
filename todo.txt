Default pattern database:
* update for proper density
* go down to 5deg? Helps 10deg fields that are partially obstructed. Doc this.
* tune for Hopper
* separate (broader) database for DIY version

auto-detect alt-az vs equatorial (with manual override)

Calibrate button.

Perfect solve stats.

Brightest star exposure adu.

Mic button on keyboard for voice input. Can work offline? Good for
"en gee cee oh five six" utterances?

Make polar advice data block tappable, zooms to larger dialog.
* polar advice can just be an "idea" icon.

Mobile app: support split screen; support picture-in-picture.

Mobile app: internal control to prevent fallback to cell networking, prefer
wifi even if no internet.

Different on-screen prompt on connection loss vs. never having connection.
Loss reasons: check server power (battery drained?), check phone's wifi
connection (sometimes phone reverts to cell connection).

Mobile app: display available Cedar* wifi access points, offer to join.

Make sure centroiding is not done on bayer image. Currently centroiding
is always done on the original full-res image; when this is color that
could lead to inaccurate centroid positions. Better way, only needed
for color original image:
if binning==2: do star detection on the 2x binned image, and centroid on
  the binned image
if binning==4: compute a 2x binned (and hot-pixel-repaired) image.
  Do star detection on the 2x further binned image, and centroid on the
  first 2x-binned image.
And be sure to apply the same processing in acquire_image_get_stars()
in the calibrator module.

Hopper LE: drop NGC/IC; drop asteroids/comets.

per-camera maximum exposure setting, or scale max exposure up for color camera.

"serve engine" pipeline stage. Moves some logic out of cedar_server.rs.

Look into networking over bluetooth as alternative to wifi.
* saves power

Update "connection lost" message for app (instead of web app).

Ability to access (and download) saved images in Cedar Aim.
Maybe save them to web side in the first place?

Tetra3
* use brightness ratio (broadly quantized) of most separated stars in
  pattern as additional discriminant (post hash lookup? or incorporate
  into hash?)

time display:
* local time, UTC
* time to sunset/sunrise, astro twilight
* display all? selectable?

torture case: cap on
* don't time out UI
* don't cause led to blink
* put up screen suggesting to check lens cap

Why need to disconnect/reconnect wifi? Symptom is that wifi
icon in phone status bar disappears even though wifi still
connected (but not providing internet)
* Android app: control fallback to cell data.
* User workaround: airplane mode, then enable wifi

Option to unset observer location (long press?)

Catalog
* text search: preprocess input, e.g. the following should all locate
  NGC0426 (and maybe others):
  NGC0426
  NGC426
  NGC 426
  NGC 0426
  N426

changing wifi doesn't take effect, need to restart server.

visual feedback on camera errors
visual feedback on connectivity errors
visual feedback on SkySafari connection

add (tm) at appropriate places for Cedar

"happy" sound on "align" button press.

alert icon if observer location not yet set.

Remove refresh rate control. Go full speed; when dwelling for more than N
seconds drop to 5hz.

Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing/downloading image

eq vs alt/az setting
* convey to SkySafari

Support Stellarium telescope control

Cedar Pole Align
* top-level mode?
* alert if no observer location
* alert if not tracking mount (or not roughly polar aligned)
* guidance for where to point scope
* king method?
Polar alignment technique:
https://www.sharpcap.co.uk/sharpcap/features/polar-alignment
https://github.com/ThemosTsikas/PhotoPolarAlign
https://www.considine.net/aplanatic/align.htm

create IOS app
create Android app
* option to download APK file from Cedar server for sideloading.
* benefits (for both): access to location info; switching
  app to SkySafari? Screen wake lock.
* control over wifi on phone?

Cedar Journal
* capture Cedar Sky goto requests (and whether target was reached)
* capture RA/DEC when long-enough dwell detected
TBD

Cedar Sky
Remaining work:
* add more catalogs
  - Caldwell (list, not catalog-- affects display logic re naming)
  - Arp, Hickson (lists, not catalogs)
  - double stars
  - stars down to some limit
  - what else?
* way to add new solar system object, e.g. comet
  - cloud-based?
* marathon ordering (advanced)
* identify constellation of boresight
* constellation lines

Push-to ra/dec button: pops up text entry field

remote ops, proxied via phone
* update cedar server
* download logs
* send bug reports

"advanced" mode enable
* polar alignment advice

bug report

interoperation with SkySafari
* goto vs. pushto
* switch apps?
* split screen?
* picture-in-picture?
* support LX200 (also for Nexus DSC)

help system
* long press? (GestureDetector wrapped around a widget)

vignetting calibration

Wifi management
* switching wifi mode-- setting in web UI?
* bluetooth? disable if not using?

FITS support for saved images? Other formats?

logging
* observer log is separate
* move cedar_log.txt to sane directory (cmd line arg?)

motion classification
* adjust update interval

UI:
* operation controls
  - save image: add confirmation+rename

Preferences:
* update rate (non-dwell, dwell)
* flip options? To match telescope FOV orientation.
  - sync with SkySafari?

Help page
* mostly redirects attention to long-press aids?

Sounds for various actions/events in app?
