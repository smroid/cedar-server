show matches/pattern stars in operate mode. Except when slewing?
* make this a preference, is ugly

* enlarge display text (check on phone)

reorganize 'cedar' repo to:
* cedar-server
* cedar-aim

daylight alignment procedure
* user points telescope at something far away such as a tree or corner
  of building
* cedar zooms the central alignment region to full screen
* user taps on whatever is centered in telescope view

auto-detect alt-az vs equatorial (with manual override)

flutter app icons

alert icon if observer location not yet set.

option to show calibration results

Tweak layout to equalize left and right panels, centering the image left/right.

change license for Cedar Aim (server & app) to AGPL or negotiated.

Remove refresh rate control. Go full speed; when dwelling for more than N
seconds drop to 5hz.

Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing image

eq vs alt/az setting
* alt/az prompts for observer location if not known -- don't bother?
* convey to SkySafari

SkySafari can send time & location to telescope mount

Support Stellarium telescope control

Cedar Pole Align
* top-level mode?
* alert if no observer location
* alert if not tracking mount (or not roughly polar aligned)
* guidance for where to point scope
* king method?

status LED
* cedar server liveness
* wifi connection status
* setting to turn off (ephemeral)

Physical button
* power-off?
* switch wifi mode?

create Android app
create IOS app
* benefits (for both): control over screen rotation; access to location info; switching
  app to SkySafari?
* control over wifi?

Cedar Journal
* capture Cedar Sky goto requests (and whether target was reached)
* capture RA/DEC when long-enough dwell detected
TBD

Lens heater with slider control

Cedar Sky
Idea: OOBE should not require Sky Safari integration
* rudimentary catalog of "beginner" objects
  - brightness
  - size
  - object type (bright star, planet, nebula, double star, open cluster,
    globular cluster, galaxy)
* slider for brightness limit
* selector boxes for object types
* display selected objects in FOV. Tap to bring up info and goto button.
* option for whole-sky (more than 5deg above current horizon) vs. near (within 45deg)
  current boresight (ranked by distance). Maybe a slider, with far setting being
  whole sky.
* ephemeris for planets/asteroids
* cloud-enabled: comets, other interlopers

Goto ra/dec button: pops up text entry field

remote ops, proxied via phone
* update cedar server
* download logs
* send bug reports

"expert" mode enable
* focus inset enable/disable (hopper is pre-focused)
* RMSE display
* eq/alt-az selector; auto checkbox
* polar alignment advice
* speed-quality slider
* option to show exposure control
* option to show stats
* re-align in target slew
* ra/dec formatting option
* refresh rate control
* FOV control
* capture image
* show detected/solved stars option
* show server log

CPU temperature

bug report

.local dns entry -- already done for us by rpi os?

interoperation with SkySafari
* switch apps?
* split screen?
* picture-in-picture?
* SkySafari "align" to refine alignment?

Polar alignment technique:
The method used in SharpCap, ASIAir and iPolar:
1. With the mount in the home position and polar axis somewhere near the pole, take a frame;
2. Rotate the polar axis approx 90 degrees, then
3. Take a second frame.
- the movement of the stars from one frame to the next defines circular arcs, all with a common centre. From the two frames determine where the polar axis is pointing.
4. Plate-solve the frame from step 3.
5. Determine the offset (altitude, azimuth) between the celestial pole and where the RA axis is pointing, and display this (ASIAir displays a bullseye, with the polar axis as a dot that has to be moved to the centre).
- User then manually adjusts mount, accordingly.
6. Repeat steps 3...5 until user presses "DONE".
Helps if you watch SharpCap or ASIAir do this in action, in the hands of a competent user it takes a few minutes.
