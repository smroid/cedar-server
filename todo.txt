show matches/pattern stars in operate mode. Except when slewing?
* make this a preference, is ugly

* enlarge display text (check on phone)

Default database:
* update for proper density
* go down to 5deg? Helps 10deg fields that are partially obstructed. Doc this.

daylight alignment procedure
* user points telescope at something far away such as a tree or corner
  of building
* cedar zooms the central alignment region to full screen
* user taps on whatever is centered in telescope view

auto-detect alt-az vs equatorial (with manual override)

clean up cedar-solve:
* get rid of star detection/centroiding support. Must use cedar-detect or
  some other detector/centroider.

flutter app icons

add (tm) at appropriate places for Cedar

investigate tethered alternative to wifi

"happy" sound on "align" button press.

alert icon if observer location not yet set.

option to show calibration results

Tweak layout to equalize left and right panels, centering the image left/right.

Remove refresh rate control. Go full speed; when dwelling for more than N
seconds drop to 5hz.

Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing image

eq vs alt/az setting
* alt/az prompts for observer location if not known -- don't bother?
* convey to SkySafari

SkySafari can send time & location to telescope mount

Support Stellarium telescope control

Cedar Pole Align
* top-level mode?
* alert if no observer location
* alert if not tracking mount (or not roughly polar aligned)
* guidance for where to point scope
* king method?

status LED
* cedar server liveness
* wifi connection status
* setting to turn off (ephemeral)

Physical button
* power-off?
* switch wifi mode?

create Android app
create IOS app
* benefits (for both): control over screen rotation; access to location info; switching
  app to SkySafari?
* control over wifi?

Cedar Journal
* capture Cedar Sky goto requests (and whether target was reached)
* capture RA/DEC when long-enough dwell detected
TBD

Cedar Sky
Idea: OOBE should not require Sky Safari integration
* rudimentary catalog of "beginner" objects
  - brightness
  - size
  - object type (bright star, planet, nebula, double star, open cluster,
    globular cluster, galaxy)
* slider for brightness limit
* selector boxes for object types
* display selected objects in FOV. Tap to bring up info and goto button.
* option for whole-sky (more than 5deg above current horizon) vs. near (within 45deg)
  current boresight (ranked by distance). Maybe a slider, with far setting being
  whole sky.
* ephemeris for planets/asteroids
* cloud-enabled: comets, other interlopers

Goto ra/dec button: pops up text entry field

remote ops, proxied via phone
* update cedar server
* download logs
* send bug reports

"expert" mode enable
* focus inset enable/disable (hopper is pre-focused)
* RMSE display
* eq/alt-az selector; auto checkbox
* polar alignment advice
* speed-quality slider
* option to show exposure control
* option to show stats
* re-align in target slew
* ra/dec formatting option
* refresh rate control
* FOV control
* capture image
* show detected/solved stars option
* show server log

CPU temperature

bug report

.local dns entry -- already done for us by rpi os?

interoperation with SkySafari
* switch apps?
* split screen?
* picture-in-picture?
* SkySafari "align" to refine alignment?
* support LX200 (also for Nexus DSC)

help system
* long press? (GestureDetector wrapped around a widget)
* 'i' icons?

make more settings durable
* accuracy slider
* update rates

vignetting calibration

Wifi management
* access point, provisioning
* switching wifi mode-- setting in web UI?
* change channel
* bluetooth? disable if not using?

FITS support for saved images? Other formats?

logging
* observer log is separate
* move cedar_log.txt to sane directory (cmd line arg?)

command line options for camera binning: yes, no, auto.

motion classification
* adjust update interval

UI:
* operation controls
  - save image: add confirmation+rename

Preferences:
* update rate (non-dwell, dwell)
* flip options? To match telescope FOV orientation.
  - sync with SkySafari?

Splash screen

About screen
* show server connection status.
* if connected, show product name, version info, etc.
* show wifi info

Help page
* mostly redirects attention to long-press aids?

Sounds for various actions/events in app?
