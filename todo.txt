Default pattern database:
* update for proper density
* go down to 5deg? Helps 10deg fields that are partially obstructed. Doc this.
* tune for Hopper
* separate (broader) database for DIY version

auto-detect alt-az vs equatorial (with manual override)

Calibrate button.

Base python scripting support for working with Cedar grpc server.

Mic button on keyboard for voice input. Can work offline? Good for
"en gee cee oh five six" utterances?

Make polar advice data block tappable, zooms to larger dialog.
* polar advice can just be an "idea" icon.

Mobile app: support split screen; support picture-in-picture.

Different on-screen prompt on connection loss vs. never having connection.
Loss reasons: check server power (battery drained?), check phone's wifi
connection (sometimes phone reverts to cell connection).

"serve engine" pipeline stage. Moves some logic out of cedar_server.rs.

Update "connection lost" message for app (instead of web app).

Ability to access (and download) saved images in Cedar Aim.
Maybe save them to web side in the first place?
High-quality jpg with exif info.

Tetra3
* use brightness ratio (broadly quantized) of most separated stars in
  pattern as additional discriminant (post hash lookup? or incorporate
  into hash?)

time display:
* local time, UTC
* time to sunset/sunrise, astro twilight
* moonrise/set
* display all? selectable?

Why need to disconnect/reconnect wifi? Symptom is that wifi
icon in phone status bar disappears even though wifi still
connected (but not providing internet)
* Android app: control fallback to cell data.
* User workaround: airplane mode, then enable wifi

Option to unset observer location (long press?)

Catalog
* text search: preprocess input, e.g. the following should all locate
  NGC0426 (and maybe others):
  NGC0426
  NGC426
  NGC 426
  NGC 0426
  N426

visual feedback on camera errors
visual feedback on connectivity errors
visual feedback on SkySafari connection

add (tm) at appropriate places for Cedar

Remove refresh rate control. Go full speed; when dwelling for more than N
seconds drop to 5hz. Use accelerometer to quickly detect resumption of
motion.

Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing/downloading image

eq vs alt/az setting
* convey to SkySafari

Support Stellarium telescope control

Cedar Pole Align
* top-level mode?
* alert if no observer location
* alert if not tracking mount (or not roughly polar aligned)
* guidance for where to point scope
* king method?
Polar alignment technique:

create IOS app
create Android app
* option to download APK file from Cedar server for sideloading.
* benefits (for both): access to location info; switching
  app to SkySafari? Screen wake lock.
* control over wifi on phone?

Cedar Journal
* capture Cedar Sky goto requests (and whether target was reached)
* capture RA/DEC when long-enough dwell detected
TBD

Cedar Sky
Remaining work:
* add more catalogs
  - Caldwell (list, not catalog-- affects display logic re naming)
  - Arp, Hickson (lists, not catalogs)
  - double stars
  - stars down to some limit
  - what else?
* find non-python solution for asteroids/comets
* way to add new solar system object, e.g. comet
  - cloud-based?
* meridian ordering (advanced)
* identify constellation of boresight
* identify constellation of planet
* constellation lines

Push-to ra/dec button: pops up text entry field

remote ops, proxied via phone
* update cedar server
* download logs
* send bug reports

"advanced" mode enable
* polar alignment advice

bug report

interoperation with SkySafari
* goto vs. pushto
* switch apps?
* split screen?
* picture-in-picture?
* support LX200 (also for Nexus DSC)

help system
* long press? (GestureDetector wrapped around a widget)

vignetting calibration

Wifi management
* switching wifi mode-- setting in web UI?
* bluetooth? disable if not using?

FITS support for saved images? Other formats?

logging
* observer log is separate
* move cedar_log.txt to sane directory (cmd line arg?)

motion classification
* adjust update interval

UI:
* operation controls
  - save image: add confirmation+rename

Help page
* mostly redirects attention to long-press aids?

Sounds for various actions/events in app?
