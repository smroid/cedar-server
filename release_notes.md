* Use a "run" directory instead of "src" directory.

* Use Raspberry Pi activity LED to convey Cedar status.
  * blinking: waiting for client to connect
  * off: client is connected

  When Cedar is not running, the activity LED reverts to reflecting
  SD card activity

* Add restart option in addition to shutdown.

# January 7 2025

Cedar-server version: 0.8.0

* Fix bugs in calibration cancellation logic.

* Remove camera temperature attribute.

* Fix bug in Rpi camera logic regarding discarding images after setting change.

* In align screen, ensure that bright star is highlighted as alignment target
  even if it is so overexposed that it is not detected as a star.

* Fix bug where activity light would blink when Cedar Aim is inactive because
  user is interacting instead with SkySafari.

* Reduce geolocation map resolution.

# January 13 2025

Cedar-server version: 0.8.1

* Fix bug that was hiding geolocation button.

* Update camera logic for Rpi5 compressed raw.

# February 15 2025

Cedar-server version: 0.9.0

* Fixes for high resolution camera modules such as the RPi HQ camera:
  * When downsampling image for display on phone, preserve star brightness.
  * Fix hit testing in alignment screen to make it easier to select
    alignment star.
  * Adjust size of focus assist inset image.

* Improve threading and locking.

* Fix bugs causing 100% CPU usage even when updating at low frequency.

* Fix TelescopePosition implementation to avoid "split updates" in
  SkySafari, eliminating occasional spurious position jumps.

* When calibrating plate solver, use longer exposure to get more stars
  for improved FOV/distortion estimates.

* Goto mode:
  * Show "Re-align" button only when close to target.
  * Adjust slew directions text block placement.
  * Add small icons for up/down and clockwise/counterclockwise.

* Reorganize Rust package structure under cedar-server component.

* Refactor Tetra3 dependency.
  * Move subprocess management into tetra3_server directory.
  * Implement new SolverTrait to use Tetra3 (Cedar-solve).
  * Update protobuf types so that Cedar does not directly depend
    on Tetra3 protobuf types.

# February 20 2025

Cedar-server version: 0.9.1

* Fixes bug where plate solve failures could cause SkySafari to
  stop getting updates until Cedar Aim app is resumed.

* Increases maximum exposure time for color cameras to 2 seconds.

# May 26 2025

Cedar-server version: 0.9.3

* Update plate solver match_threshold to 1e-5, reducing the chance of
  a false solution.

* Fix hanging behavior in solver.

* Improve auto-exposure algorithms.

* Always rotate image to zenith up when not in focus or daytime align mode.

* If calibration fails, stay in current mode (focus or daytime align).

* Other calibration fixes.

* Add interstitial explanation screens for startup, focus, and align.

* Broaden target tap tolerance in align mode.

* Increase text sizes, tweak layouts.

* Improve formatting of push-to directions.

# June 23 2025

* Add more information screens.

* Add "don't show again" checkbox on information screens.

* When changing camera parameters, continue to process images that
  don't yet reflect the parameter change.

* Tweak hot pixel detection logic.

* Auto exposure improvements.

* Update calibration and auto exposure logic to not raise
  exposure too high when trying to increase star count. This
  might fix reported "white out" problems.

* Fix occasional hang on calibration failure.

# July 1 2025

Cedar-server version: 0.11.0

* Display central square crop of camera image instead of full camera image.

* Adjust app layout to take advantage of larger data/control panels around
  square image.

* In about screen camera information, reflect when demo image is being used.

* Don't hold camera lock when waiting for next exposure to be ready; this was
  causing UI responsiveness problems.

* Clean up other locking issues.

* Once LED turns off (when app connects), don't turn LED back on (e.g. when app
  goes to sleep due to screen off etc.).

* Make FOV bullseye more visible in daylight align mode.

* Add haptic feedback in align mode and for re-align.

# August 2 2025

Cedar-server version: 0.12.2

* Update/fix auto-exposure logic.

* Update/fix exposure calibration logic.

* Star count gauge displays moving average rather than instantaneous value.

* Fix daylight mode auto-exposure.

* On exposure calibration failure, UI pops a message identifying reason:
  Too few stars due to lens cap being covered; sky too bright.

* Improved twilight tolerance.
